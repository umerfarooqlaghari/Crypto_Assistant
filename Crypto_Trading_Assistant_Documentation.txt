TRADING LEVELS CALCULATION
===============================================================================

Entry Price:
- Always: Current market price (real-time)

Stop Loss Calculation:

For BUY Signals:
Stop Loss = MAX(Bollinger Band Lower, Current Price × 0.97)
- Uses Bollinger Band lower bound OR 3% below current price (whichever is higher)

For SELL Signals:
Stop Loss = MIN(Bollinger Band Upper, Current Price × 1.03)
- Uses Bollinger Band upper bound OR 3% above current price (whichever is lower)

For HOLD Signals:
Stop Loss = Current Price × 0.98 (2% below current price)

Take Profit Levels:

For BUY Signals:
- TP1: Current Price × 1.02 (2% profit)
- TP2: Current Price × 1.04 (4% profit)
- TP3: Current Price × 1.06 (6% profit) OR Bollinger Band upper

For SELL Signals:
- TP1: Current Price × 0.98 (2% profit)
- TP2: Current Price × 0.96 (4% profit)
- TP3: Current Price × 0.94 (6% profit) OR Bollinger Band lower

For HOLD Signals:
- TP1: Current Price × 1.01 (1% profit)
- TP2: Current Price × 1.02 (2% profit)
- TP3: Current Price × 1.03 (3% profit)


SIGNAL TYPES EXPLAINED
===============================================================================

BUY Signal (Net Score > +20):
- Meaning: Strong bullish momentum detected across multiple indicators
- Action: Consider entering a long position (buying the cryptocurrency)
- Conditions: Bullish indicators significantly outweigh bearish ones
- Spot Trading: Shows entry price, stop loss, and take profit levels

SELL Signal (Net Score < -20):
- Meaning: Strong bearish momentum detected
- Action: Consider selling your holdings or avoiding new purchases
- Conditions: Bearish indicators significantly outweigh bullish ones
- Spot Trading: Only shows the signal (no entry/TP/SL since you can't short 
  in spot trading)

HOLD Signal (-20 ≤ Net Score ≤ +20):
- Meaning: Mixed signals or market consolidation
- Action: Maintain current positions, wait for clearer direction
- Conditions: Bullish and bearish signals are roughly balanced
- Strategy: Conservative approach during uncertain market conditions


CONFIDENCE LEVEL EXPLANATION
===============================================================================

Confidence indicates how certain the system is about the signal direction:

For BUY/SELL Signals:
- Formula: (|Net Score| / 50) × 100
- Range: 60% to 100%
- Interpretation:
  * 60-70%: Moderate confidence, decent signal
  * 70-85%: High confidence, strong signal
  * 85-100%: Very high confidence, excellent signal

For HOLD Signals:
- Formula: 70 - |Net Score| × 2
- Range: 30% to 65% (capped)
- Interpretation:
  * 30-45%: Low confidence, very mixed signals
  * 45-60%: Moderate confidence, reasonable to wait
  * 60-65%: High confidence in holding, balanced market

Key Point: HOLD signals are intentionally capped at 65% confidence because 
mixed signals inherently carry more uncertainty.


SIGNAL STRENGTH EXPLANATION
===============================================================================

Signal Strength measures the absolute intensity of market activity:

Calculation:
- Formula: Math.abs(Net Score)
- Range: 0 to 100+
- Source: Combined activity from all technical indicators

Strength Levels:

High Strength (70-100+):
- Market State: High volatility, strong momentum
- Meaning: Multiple indicators firing, major market movement
- Examples: Breakouts, trend accelerations, news-driven moves

Medium Strength (30-70):
- Market State: Normal trading conditions
- Meaning: Moderate technical activity
- Examples: Regular price movements, some indicator signals

Low Strength (0-30):
- Market State: Quiet, consolidating market
- Meaning: Very little technical activity
- Examples: Sideways movement, low volatility periods

Strength vs. Confidence:
- Strength: How much is happening (market energy)
- Confidence: How sure we are about direction (prediction reliability)


SIGNAL GENERATION ALGORITHM
===============================================================================

Scoring System:
The system uses a point-based scoring approach:

Bullish Points:
- RSI < 30 (Oversold): +25 points
- MACD Bullish Crossover: +20 points
- EMA20 > EMA50: +15 points
- Stochastic Oversold: +15 points
- Bullish Chart Patterns: +confidence × 0.3
- Bullish Candlestick Patterns: +confidence × 0.2

Bearish Points:
- RSI > 70 (Overbought): +25 points
- MACD Bearish Crossover: +20 points
- EMA20 < EMA50: +15 points
- Stochastic Overbought: +15 points
- Bearish Chart Patterns: +confidence × 0.3
- Bearish Candlestick Patterns: +confidence × 0.2

Final Calculation:
Net Score = Bullish Points - Bearish Points
Signal Strength = |Net Score|

BEST PRACTICES FOR CLIENTS
===============================================================================

1. Use Multiple Timeframes: Check signals across different timeframes for 
   confirmation

2. Consider Strength + Confidence: High strength + high confidence = best signals

3. Risk Management: Always use stop losses, never risk more than you can afford 
   to lose

4. Market Context: Consider overall market conditions and news events

5. Position Sizing: Adjust position size based on signal strength and confidence

6. Patience: Wait for high-quality setups rather than forcing trades
