CRYPTO ASSISTANT - CONFIDENCE & STRENGTH SIGNAL CALCULATION SYSTEM
===============================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
The system uses a comprehensive scoring algorithm that combines 4 core technical
indicators, chart patterns, and candlestick patterns to generate confidence and
strength signals for trading decisions.

CORE TECHNICAL INDICATORS (4 INDICATORS)
===============================================================================

1. RSI (RELATIVE STRENGTH INDEX)
   - Period: 14 candles
   - Range: 0-100
   - Calculation: Standard RSI formula using average gains/losses
   - Scoring:
     * RSI < 30 (Oversold): +25 BULLISH points
     * RSI > 70 (Overbought): +25 BEARISH points
     * RSI 30-70: No points (neutral)

2. MACD (MOVING AVERAGE CONVERGENCE DIVERGENCE)
   - Fast EMA: 12 periods
   - Slow EMA: 26 periods  
   - Signal Line: 9-period EMA of MACD line
   - Histogram: MACD - Signal Line
   - Scoring:
     * MACD > Signal AND Histogram > 0: +20 BULLISH points
     * MACD < Signal AND Histogram < 0: +20 BEARISH points

3. BOLLINGER BANDS
   - Period: 20 candles
   - Standard Deviation: 2
   - Components: Upper Band, Middle (SMA20), Lower Band
   - Scoring:
     * Price > Upper Band: +25 BEARISH points (overbought)
     * Price < Lower Band: +25 BULLISH points (oversold)
   - Also used for breakout pattern detection

4. EMA (EXPONENTIAL MOVING AVERAGES)
   - EMA20: 20-period exponential moving average
   - EMA50: 50-period exponential moving average
   - Scoring:
     * EMA20 > EMA50: +15 BULLISH points (uptrend)
     * EMA20 < EMA50: +15 BEARISH points (downtrend)



CHART PATTERNS (ADVANCED DETECTION)
===============================================================================

DETECTED PATTERNS:
1. Head and Shoulders (Bearish) - Confidence: 75%
2. Double Top (Bearish) - Confidence: 70%
3. Double Bottom (Bullish) - Confidence: 70%
4. Ascending Triangle (Bullish) - Confidence: 65%
5. Descending Triangle (Bearish) - Confidence: 65%
6. Bollinger Band Breakout (Bullish) - Confidence: 60%
7. Bollinger Band Breakdown (Bearish) - Confidence: 60%

SCORING FORMULA:
- Bullish Chart Pattern: +(Pattern Confidence × 0.3) points
- Bearish Chart Pattern: +(Pattern Confidence × 0.3) points

Example: Head and Shoulders (75% confidence) = +22.5 bearish points

CANDLESTICK PATTERNS (REVERSAL & CONTINUATION)
===============================================================================

DETECTED PATTERNS:
1. Morning Star (Bullish) - Confidence: 85%
2. Evening Star (Bearish) - Confidence: 85%
3. Bullish Engulfing (Bullish) - Confidence: 80%
4. Bearish Engulfing (Bearish) - Confidence: 80%
5. Hammer (Bullish) - Confidence: 75%
6. Hanging Man (Bearish) - Confidence: 75%
7. Doji (Neutral) - Confidence: 70%

SCORING FORMULA:
- Bullish Candlestick: +(Pattern Confidence × 0.2) points
- Bearish Candlestick: +(Pattern Confidence × 0.2) points

Example: Bullish Engulfing (80% confidence) = +16 bullish points

FINAL CALCULATION ALGORITHM
===============================================================================

STEP 1: ACCUMULATE POINTS
- Start with 0 bullish points and 0 bearish points
- Add points from each indicator based on conditions above
- Add points from detected chart patterns
- Add points from detected candlestick patterns

STEP 2: CALCULATE NET SCORE
Net Score = Total Bullish Points - Total Bearish Points

STEP 3: DETERMINE ACTION
- Net Score > +20: BUY signal
- Net Score < -20: SELL signal  
- Net Score between -20 and +20: HOLD signal

STEP 4: CALCULATE CONFIDENCE
- BUY/SELL: confidence = min(max((|Net Score| / 50) × 100, 60), 100)
- HOLD: confidence = min(max(30, 70 - |Net Score| × 2), 65)

STEP 5: CALCULATE STRENGTH
Signal Strength = |Net Score| (absolute value of net score)

EXAMPLE CALCULATION
===============================================================================

Sample Analysis for BTCUSDT:
- RSI: 25 (oversold) → +25 bullish points
- MACD: Bullish crossover → +20 bullish points
- EMA: EMA20 > EMA50 → +15 bullish points
- Bollinger Bands: Price below lower band → +25 bullish points
- Chart Pattern: Double Bottom (70%) → +21 bullish points
- Candlestick: Hammer (75%) → +15 bullish points

Total: 121 bullish points, 0 bearish points
Net Score: +121
Action: BUY (score > 20)
Confidence: min(max((121/50) × 100, 60), 100) = 100%
Strength: 121

CONFIDENCE RANGES
===============================================================================
- 90-100%: Very High Confidence (strong signals across multiple indicators)
- 70-89%: High Confidence (most indicators agree)
- 50-69%: Medium Confidence (mixed signals, some agreement)
- 30-49%: Low Confidence (conflicting signals)

STRENGTH RANGES  
===============================================================================
- 80-100: Very Strong Signal
- 60-79: Strong Signal
- 40-59: Moderate Signal
- 20-39: Weak Signal
- 0-19: Very Weak Signal

DATA REQUIREMENTS
===============================================================================
- Minimum: 50 candles for accurate analysis
- Optimal: 100 candles for full pattern recognition
- Real-time updates via WebSocket for price changes
- 5-minute cache for OHLCV data to reduce API calls

TIMEFRAME SUPPORT
===============================================================================
- 1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d
- Each timeframe analyzed independently
- Same algorithm applied across all timeframes
- Results may vary significantly between timeframes
