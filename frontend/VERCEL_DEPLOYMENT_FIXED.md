## 🧪 Testing

### Local Build Test
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
npm start
```

### Production Verification
After deployment, verify:
- ✅ All styling appears correctly (no unstyled HTML)
- ✅ Fonts load properly with fallbacks
- ✅ Responsive design works
- ✅ Dark/light mode works
- ✅ All components are styled

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If CSS Still Missing:
1. Clear browser cache and hard refresh
2. Check browser developer tools for CSS loading errors
3. Verify Tailwind classes are being generated in build

### If Fonts Don't Load:
1. Check network tab for font loading errors
2. Verify Google Fonts are accessible
3. Fallback fonts (system-ui, Arial) should still work

### If Build Fails:
1. Check Vercel build logs for specific errors
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Ensure root directory is set to `frontend`

## 📱 Backend Requirements

Your backend must support:
- ✅ HTTPS (required for production)
- ✅ CORS for your Vercel domain
- ✅ WebSocket over HTTPS (WSS) for real-time features

### CORS Configuration Example:
```javascript
const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors({
  origin: [
    'http://localhost:3000',
    'https://your-app-name.vercel.app',
    'https://your-custom-domain.com'
  ]
}));
```
